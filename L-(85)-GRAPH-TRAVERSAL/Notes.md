// Graph Traversal.

(1) Graph Traversal Refer To The Process Of Visiting (Checking Update each Node in The Graph).

(2) Sequence Of Steps Known As Graph Traversal Algorithm Can Be Used To Traverse a Graph. 

(3) Two Algorithm Of Graph Traversal Is: 
    (i) Breadth First Traversal (BFS). Queue Data Structure (FIFO).
    (ii) Depth First Traversal (DFS).  Stack Data Structure.
