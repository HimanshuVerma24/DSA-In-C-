(3) Pass :- The Element Goes In The Sorted Array. 

(4) 1st Pass :- The Adjecent Element Will Go In Sorted Array And Placed At Correct Position. 

(5) If Length Is n Then Passes Will Be n-1. 

(6) Time Complexity :- Worst Case O(n^2), Best O(n).

(7) Stability :- Insertion Sort Is Stable In Nature.

(8) Adaptable :- Yes It Is Adaptable In Nature. Don't Need To Make Adaptive Like Bubble Sort.
