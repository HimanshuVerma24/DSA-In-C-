// Analysis Criteria Of Sorting. 

(1) Time Complexity :- O(n^2) And O(log(n)).

(2) Inplace Sorting Algorithm:- It Require Constant Memory To Execute The Sorting. Chahe Wo 9 Ya 9K Ka Array Ho Constant Memory Lega. 

(3) Not Inplace Sorting Algorithm :- It Extend Memory With Large Array To Sort The Array.

(4) Stability :- If Duplicate Elements Are Come In Array, Then It Will Do Not Sort And Do Not Change Order. 

(5) Internal Sorting System :- All The Data Is Loaded Into The Memory. 

(6) External Sorting System :- All The Data Is Not Loaded Into The Memory. 

(7) Adaptive :- Already Sorted Data Less Time.
