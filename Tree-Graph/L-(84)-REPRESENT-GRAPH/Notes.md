// Representation Of the Graphs

(1) Adjacency Lists - Marks The Nodes With The Lists Of Its Neighbour. (How Many Vertices Are Connected). 

(2) Adjacency Matrix :- Aij = 1  For An Edge Between i And j, 0 Otherwise. 

(3) Edge Set :- Store The Pair Of The Nodes/Vertices Connected With An Edge.{(0,1),(0,4),(1,4)}. 

(4) Other Impplementations To Reptresent a Graph Also Exists. For Example Compact List Representation, Cost Adjacency List, Cost Adjacency Matrix. 

(5) Every Adjacency List Will Form a Linked List. 

(6) Cost Adjacency List :- Cost Is Also Stored Along The Links. 

(7) Compact List Representation :- The Entire Graph Is Stored In a 1D Array.
