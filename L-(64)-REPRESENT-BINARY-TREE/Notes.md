// Representation Of a Binary Tree
                                                                                                                        
(1) Array Representation :- (Less Used) Bcz Array Cannot Be Resize, We Must Give Size Before Making The Tree. 
                            (a) The Array Index Will Start From Root Node And Next Index Will Move From Left To Right. 
                            
                            (b)In Array We Cannot Extend The Tree, We Will Make New Array To Resize The Tree. 

(2) Linked Representation :- (Mostly Used) : (By Doublee Linked List) 

    Declaration Of Tree 
    struct node{        
    int data;           
    struct node* left;  
    struct node* right; 
    };
