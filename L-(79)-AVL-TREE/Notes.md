// AVL Tree :- Aldson velsky & Emlands

(1) It Is Used To Make The Tree Whose Height Is Less And Perform Minimum Number Of Operation Like :- Searching, Deletion, Insertion. 

(2) All Most All The Operation In a Binary Tree Are Of Order O(h) Where h is The Height Of The Tree.

(3) If We Don't Plan Our Tree Properly, This Height Can Get As High As n Where n Is The Number Of Nodes In a BST(Skwed Tree).

(4) To Gurantee An Upper Bound Of O(log n) For All These Operations, We Use Balanced Tree. 

(5) It Is Also Called The Height Balanced Binary Search Tree.

(6) Height Difference Between Heights Of The Left ANd Right Suntree Of Every Node Is Less Than Or Equal To 1.

(7) B.F = Height Of Right Subtree - Height Of Left Subtree. 

(8) Can Be -1,0,1 For a Node To Be Balanced In BST.

(9) Can Be -1,0,1 For All Nodes Of An AVL Tree. 

(10) To Balance The AVL Tree You Must Rotate The Tree. 

(11) AVl Convert The List Tree Into Minimum Operation BST. 

(12) In AVL Insertion And Deletion Is Hard As Compare To BST.
